Since starting her CKO journey Sid has had a lot of success, from improved her posture, obtaining a stronger core, building tone muscles and gaining self-confidence.

To learn more about Sid, read the interview below.

**The Sid Carden Interview:**

**Besides being a member of CKO, what is your day job? **

_Day and night job is being Mom to two fabulous kids. Earning money job is that I am a middle school science teacher._

**Do you have any hobbies? **

_Lots of hobbies that include hiking, camping and traveling. I am an avid reader of young adult sci-fi fantasy books. We are huge soccer fans. My kids play soccer year-round and so I am a soccer sideline mom standing out in all kinds of weather (mostly rain!) and we love our Sounders and go to see them play at home._

_I am also an artist. I paint with acrylics mostly. You can see my work hanging in the 'Ladros Cafe' in Lynnwood and Edmonds._

**How did you first learn of CKO? **

_My friend Julie became a member last summer and raved about it and encouraged me to take the free trial class that is offered. Of course that is all it took and I was hooked_.

**What is your favorite aspect of CKO? **

_When I walked in the door I saw every shape and size. No one was self conscious, it was all about them and their bag and their own journey. I loved that there was a variety of levels from beginners and experts but no one was judging the other. The level of encouragement from the participants was fabulous, how they pumped you up telling you what a great job you had done. I love how each instructor is different and the variety of workouts keep you challenged. You cannot let your guard down as the instructors change it up constantly._

**What motivates you to walk through that door day after day and continue to push yourself? **

_Family, friends,the instructors and myself._

_My family works around my schedule to enable me to put in a workout. This is a huge[support][0]because I could easily use this as an excuse to not go. They see how much better I feel about myself and continue encouraging me. Also my kids are pretty impressed by my bad-ass self on the bag!_

_Friends, especially [Jeanie][1] and Julie, coordinating when we can do workouts together, you know the, 'if you go, I'll go' mentality. Being accountable to more than yourself can get your butt off the couch._

_The instructors are really motivating. They give you [goals][2] and acknowledge every step you are taking to improve yourself. They help you see that every step no matter how small makes a difference, whether you walked through the doors, improve by 1% or hit that bag a little harder it is making the change you want._

_Myself because I know it does take effort and I am acknowledging that I am putting myself forward to make the improvements that only I can make._

**What's one thing you still find yourself struggling with?**

_The main struggle for me is eating correctly. I am a big carbohydrate eater. Its easy and when you have a busy family they are the easy go to ( yes I am making excuses now)._

**If we do a follow up interview 1-year from now, what awesome accomplishment would we be celebrating?**

_That I am still punching and kicking and that I am eating less carbs!_

**What is one book or documentary that you have read that changed your life?**

_To say that any one book or documentary has changed my life would be an overstatement. I read '[The happiness project][3]' and really liked some of the suggestions to take control of your life. Al Gore's presentation on global warming, "[Inconvenient Truth][4]" is something everyone should watch and the documentary called '[Tapped][5]' about the bottled water industry._

**Where do you see yourself in 5-years?**

_Still teaching, still being soccer mom, still staying in shape._

**Share any relevant information you'd like about yourself that other CKO team members might not know about you (also a good place to talk about any success you have had since joining CKO)!**

_I have been going to CKO since January 2015\. It has been an amazing place for my fitness goals and just as a stress reliever. Since going my body has become firmer which has given me a lot more confidence. I have noticed my posture has improved and I have had back injuries in the past and CKO has made my core much stronger._

_I love going and love how people come up to each other congratulating each other on a job well done. CKO fosters a community which I am grateful for._
