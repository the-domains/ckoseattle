Meet Sydney Shub a full time collage student, a bartender/server (30-hrs per week), a CKO badass, and a recent graduate of the [21-day habit hack][2].

In one year Sydney lost 40-lbs, **12 of those pounds came from transforming her diet during the 21-day habit hack**.

Read below to learn more about Sydney's transformation.

June 2014 to September 2015

The Sydney Shub interview:

**Besides being a member of CKO, what is your day job?**

_I am a full time student. I take 15 credits each quarter. I also work for The Ram Restaurant & Brewery as a Bartender/Server. I work about 30 hours each week at the restaurant._

**Do you have any hobbies?**

_I enjoy watching/playing sports. I played soccer/lacrosse my whole life except for the past 3 years. It has been hard not playing, and I want to find a coaching job. I also have a wonderful dog who I love taking out and playing with._

**How did you first learn of CKO?**

_I have always had an interest in kickboxing, so one day I researched online some kickboxing places in Seattle and that is when I found CKO. I signed up for a free trial class and the rest is history._

**What is your favorite aspect of CKO?**

_I love that CKO is for everyone and not just one type of person. Everyone has been in the same position as you when you do your first class, even the instructors have similar stories and goals that they are accomplishing with you._

**What motivates you to walk through that door day after day and continue to push yourself?**

_I love how I feel after each class. I feel so much better. Even if I do not do anything else the entire day I feel that I have accomplished something._

**What's one thing you still find yourself struggling with?**

_I still struggle with some of the workouts, but I know that I have improved since the first day I started and that is all that matters. Outside of CKO I struggle with my eating habits. It is hard working at a sports bar and being in school all day while trying to eat healthy._

**What was your experience with the 21-day habit hack?**

_No matter what there are going to be obstacles in your way and excuses for you not to start a program such as the habit hack. I decided that there was never going to be a perfect time to do a habit hack, so I decided to start as soon as I could. I loved it. I loved that everything was laid out for me and that I did not have to come up with what I was going to eat each day. It went by really fast. I think that depending on your attitude, 21 days can go by as slow or as fast as you want._

_I successfully lost 12 pounds during the 21 day habit hack._

**What surprised you or what did you learn about yourself during the 21-day habit hack? **

_I felt good every morning. When I do not eat healthy I feel bad and gross the next day. I did not feel that way at all during the habit hack. I also realized how good some of the food is that you can eat. I am going to continue to use the recipes that I learned during the habit hack. (My boyfriend loved some of them too)_

**If we do a follow up interview 1-year from now, what awesome accomplishment would we be celebrating?**

_In one year we will celebrate all the hard work that I am continuing to do. I will still be working out a lot and being the best person that I can be._

**When you think of successful people who comes to mind, and why?**

_(I can't really think of anyone in particular for this question) All I can say is anyone who is fighting for what they want is successful in my book._

**What is one book or documentary that you have read that changed your life?**

_The documentary "Fed Up" on Netflix is very interesting! It is all about Sugar and Diet and our food industry. I suggest anyone that has Netflix to watch it!_

**Where do you see yourself in 5-years?**

_I will be done with school (hopefully) and in a job that I love to do. I will be happy and healthy and hopefully planning my future life (I am still very young)_

**Share any relevant information you'd like about yourself that other CKO/2.0 team members might not know about you (also a good place to talk about any success you have had since joining CKO)!**

_Since I started my weight loss journey in June of 2014 I have lost 40 pounds. Obesity runs in my family and I am ready to stop that trend. I was always an active person, but when I broke my collar-bone while playing lacrosse I had to stop playing and that is when I started to gain weight. Joining [CKO][3] and doing training has been wonderful and I suggest that anyone who has not tried it to take a free trial class. I struggled a lot when I first started, but I kept going and eventually it got easier and I saw myself and my body changing a lot._
