<p>So at this point his story has two possible outcomes:</p><ul><li><strong>Outcome 1</strong>– Joshua acknowledges that the class was hard (and that we are in fact crazy), but realizes that if he can come consistently he will no doubt see life changing results.</li><li><strong>Outcome 2</strong>– the<a title="Do Simulated Workouts Give Real Life Results?" href="http://healthylifeexperiment.com/2014/04/29/do-simulated-workouts-give-real-life-results/">intensity</a> of the class scares him and he thinks, “I need to get into shape before I come back”.</li></ul><p>So after class, Jon and Joshua talked for what seemed like 15-mins, the whole time Joshua had the “this guy is crazy” look on his face, lol! But at the end of the conversation Joshua signed-up for 1-year, choosing outcome #1 and has not looked back since!</p><p>Joshua, has been a CKO member for 8-months and has completely transformed both physically and mentally.  Physically he is an animal, I canhonestly say he gives everything</p><p>(I don’t say this often).  Joshua went from a guy that barely made it through class to being one of the strongest people in the entire gym. At the end of the 10-week challenge he did a 10-min plank, which is the longest plank I have ever seen, he also did a 12-min wall sit! And just the other day we went and ran stairs as a gym and I had a hard time keeping up with his pace!</p><p>Mentally Joshua’s attitude about health and fitness could not be better, he gets <a title="What would you think if you met yourself?" href="http://healthylifeexperiment.com/2014/02/17/what-would-you-think-if-you-met-yourself/">IT</a>! He understands that the <a title="What do your actions say about you?" href="http://healthylifeexperiment.com/2014/01/27/you-are-defined-by-your-actions/">habits</a>he creates in the gym will translate to all other aspects of his life. Joshua has barely scratched the surface of his potential and I see this “hunger” in him that says “watch out world, here I come”.</p><picture>

<p>;)</p><p>Read more about Joshua’s story below:</p><p><strong>Besides being a CKO Superhero, what is your day job? </strong></p><p><em>By day I am a maintenance engineer at the Edgewater Hotel, helping keep the place afloat!, haha! </em></p><p><strong>Do you have any hobbies?</strong></p><p><em>I love to play music. I am primarily a guitarist, but will try any instrument.  I also do ceramic art, functional pottery and sculpture.</em></p><p><strong>How did you first learn of CKO?</strong></p><p><em>I do shopping in the area, and always saw people really moving around inside.  I was looking to make a change for the better in my life, and after some stellar reviews, I decided to sign up for a free class.  After Jon gave me my tutorial and one session, I knew this was what I was looking for!</em></p><p><strong>What are some of your fitness goals?</strong></p><p><em>I want to be healthy, athletic, and strong!  I want to look good too! who doesn’t?  By healthy, athletic, and strong, I also mean using the fitness of my body to effect of all aspects of my life, and help others along the way.</em></p><p>January 2014</p><p><strong>What is your favorite aspect of CKO? </strong></p><p><em>I really enjoy the community aspect of CKO<strong>.  </strong>I have never been part of  gym that has so much support for members from staff, trainers and other members as well.  The staff really care about the members and are always willing to answer questions and give advice on technique, nutrition, and anything in between. Everyone from top to bottom really pushes and encourages each other, creating  a real family atmosphere.  We all are there to make improvements to ourselves and the positivity you feel really makes you want to push your limits, and the person on the bag next to you.  I have met so many awesome people who inspire me everyday at CKO, and I love how we encourage and support one another. Bottom line it is just a great place to be.  </em></p><p><strong>What was the best part about the challenge?</strong></p><p><em>There were so many great things about the challenge, It is hard to pinpoint just one. I will say my favorite part of the challenge was taking the knowledge given to me about nutrition, exercise, and health, then pushing myself to the limit, and then feeling myself getting stronger.  Some days were harder than others, feeling tired and drained, and then all of a sudden you could do Money Mayweather sit ups! That is a great feeling!  It also gave me a real  framework to focus everything. I had real feedback and numbers to gauge my progress.   The stronger I felt, the more determined I became to keep focused and take it to the limit. I could barely do 3 pull-ups at the beginning, and sure enough by the end I could do 10 no problem.    </em></p><p>CINCO Saturday!!!</p><p><strong>What was the hardest part about the challenge?</strong></p><p><em>The hardest part for me was meal planning, and prepping all my food in advance to make the nutrition as convenient as possible  I never realized how much time was involved with cooking meals, and probably the reason why i had slipped so far down the fitness hole.  I had never really been a good cook, and had to learn quickly.  Food choices were not too difficult but I found myself ever trying to keep up with prep and timing.  I eventually got the hang of it, and had to keep reminding myself that the food was life, and I wanted to live. </em></p><p><strong>What motivates you to walk through that door day after day and continue to push yourself?</strong></p><p><em>I don’t think I have ever reached my full potential in life, physically, professionally, or creatively.  There has always been something out of whack with my exercise game, and I never pushed those boundaries.  I was a weak person in many respects which led me to some not so great places in life. I believe that for me, my potential begins with my physical nature, and all else follows from there. The further I  push myself, and the stronger I get, the better my mind becomes. The better my mind becomes, the better I feel about myself, and others around me as well, thus being a better person. The confidence of being a better person, allows me to see and attack the opportunities presented in life. Therefore every day I walk through those doors (CKO Kickboxing) I believe I am one step closer to reaching my full potential as a person. </em></p><p><strong>What’s one thing you still find yourself struggling with? </strong></p><p><em>I struggle with coffee. I think it is just such a habit of the work environments I have always been a part of, that it is ritualistic.  I love the <a title="Time to Become Bulletproof" href="http://healthylifeexperiment.com/2014/01/22/time-to-become-bulletproof/">Bulletproof coffee</a>, and really enjoy it, but need to limit it to that.  I also struggle with variety of foods I make, and believe if I expand my cooking, I might discover more foods that power me up!  It is a journey and an experiment, the greatest one of all!</em></p><p><strong>What can we do better to help you actualize your true potential? </strong></p><p><em>I think CKO as a gym does as much as any gym I have attended to help their members reach their full potential.  Keep the challenges, events, and social aspects coming, because I have really found some great gains personally and physically within them.  The 10 week challenge showed me what the benefits of circuit training, bootcamps, and personal training can do. If there was anything else CKO can do, other than the awesomeness that they already do, that could help me reach my full potential, it would be more class times and more times.  I know it is asking a lot, but the bootcamps really pushed my limits, and the variety of them got me out of my comfort zone. I know we all share so much information on nutrition, exercise and food, via the web and the Healthy Life Experiment, but what about a “book or movie of the month type club”, where there is a <a title="Life Upgrades" href="http://healthylifeexperiment.com/life-upgrades-being-the-total-package/">suggested read</a> or watch of the month. I would appreciate that for sure.</em></p><p><strong>Share any relevant information you’d like about yourself that other CKO team members might not know about you (also a good place to talk about any success you have had since joining CKO)!  </strong></p><p><em>Playing music is a hobby, but for a while it was almost a living, and I did do a small tour in Europe shortly before joining CKO. It was a great life experience, and am glad i got to do it.  I love music, but the touring life, on the lower levels was not a good environment for your health.  I drank a lot, didn’t get much sleep, ate poorly, and this resulted in an unhealthy lifestyle.  The band I was in broke up, and I was left fat, depressed, and with some bad habits.  Not too long after  that, I joined CKO.  The gym has really been a place where I have reclaimed my health and my life, literally.  The moment I came in the door the first time, and Jon Rogers gave me the tutorial, I felt the positive vibe that I used to feel when you start playing in a new music group, and the feeling after was like after playing a show. My endorphin’s were alive, I was dripping sweat, I felt accomplished, and I was sharing a great experience with the people next to me.  I knew this was going to change the game.  Since joining CKO, not only have I gotten a greater grip on many aspects of my life, I find myself hungry to strive for my best in everything.I respect myself way more, and thus others as well.  Physically it is been a wild ride for sure. I have lost over 40 lbs, and went from a size 38 to a 33 or even 32 in pants size. I can do exercises I never thought I could, as well as holding a plank for 10 and a half minutes after the 10 week challenge.  I surprised myself with that one for sure. I could go on and on for sure, but I will just say thank you, and giant heartfelt thank you!!!! </em></p><picture>
